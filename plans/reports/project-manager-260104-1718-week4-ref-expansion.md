## Unresolved Questions

1. **Cultivation resource terms:** Should we merge with `Library_HANJA_MURIM_TERMS.md` or keep in Ref_CULTIVATION_STAGES.md?
   - **Recommendation:** Keep basic 30+ terms in Ref file for quick reference, full 500+ database in Library file

2. **Family clan systems:** Tang vs Namgung hierarchy differs significantly - create sub-decision trees or general guidelines?
   - **Recommendation:** General guidelines + 2 detailed clan examples (Tang, Namgung), note variations

3. **Vietnamese pronoun system:** Deep integration needed - should we cross-reference existing `Ref_VIETNAMESE_PRONOUN_SYSTEM.md`?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, add explicit cross-reference section + 25 Murim-specific examples

4. **Target audience:** Are these files for LLM training or human translator reference?
   - **Current assumption:** Both - structure supports LLM parsing + human readability

## Next Steps (Recommended Sequence)

1. **Immediate:** Assign expansion tasks to main agent (backend-developer or content specialist)
2. **Task 2.1 Priority:** Breakthrough scenarios + Combat evolution (highest translation value)
3. **Task 2.2 Priority:** Vietnamese integration guide (critical for actual translation work)
4. **Testing:** After expansion, validate with 5 ROTMHS passages to confirm terminology coverage
5. **Integration:** Update KR_MURIM_TRANSLATOR.xml references to new content sections

---

## Resource Requirements

- **Effort:** ~8-10 hours total (5h Task 2.1 + 3h Task 2.2 + 2h validation)
- **Dependencies:** Access to ROTMHS glossary, Korean-Vietnamese dictionary, existing Library files
- **Validation:** Need 5 sample passages (breakthrough scene, sect meeting, combat, family conflict, multi-sect conference)
